# My personal blog

Just a small personal blog on GitHub pages.

## Functions
- [x] Publish an article
- [x] Article comments
- [x] Set labels for article
- [x] Search for aticle
- [x] Like an article or comment
- [x] API. It can output 'json' format information. Using methods are at the bottom of README.
- [x] Issue Filter. You can filter your issues by creator or issue state (open or close). Multi-creator filtering is currently not supported.

You can publish your article in Github issues page, just click 'New issue'.

The comments feature is referenced by [Gitment](https://github.com/imsun/gitment). I borrowed its css and rewrite the js doc.

You can set labels for each article in Github issues page.
