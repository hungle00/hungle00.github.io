                 <p>I was thinking about this recently, while listening to a student play a shifting exercise perfectly in tune, hitting every ringing tone dead-on. I actually had to fight the urge to make her repeat the exercise, just so I could hear it again. So in-tune! I smiled - intonation bliss.</p>
                  <p>What made it even more blissful was the fact that this very same student, just a few years ago, played very out-of-tune, most of the the time. The transformation was remarkable.</p>
                  <p>While some students never need a primer in pitch, sometimes a student just doesn't seem to hear pitch at all. The student plays out of tune, without even noticing it. A teacher can stop and fix things, but ultimately the student must be able to do that for himself or herself. The violin requires incredible precision - there's just one "in tune" and countless ways to play "out of tune." </p>
